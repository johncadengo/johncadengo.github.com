<h1>Fibonacci</h1>

<p>Problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
    
    <p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    
    <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>I'd like you to come up with 3 different solutions. The first has to be iterative. The second has to be recursive. And the last has to be efficient. Use the information you learn from the previous two solutions and any clues in the question to come up with a clever solution to the stated problem that has the fastest running time. If you can, time the three implementations and see if your optimizations are notable improvements.</p>

<h2>Your solutions</h2>
