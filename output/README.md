My programmer's blog. It will be pretty sparse for now, but as time goes on I plan to build my own little static blog generator, like Jekyll and Octopress, but much simpler and mostly for my own personal needs. 

Also, be sure to checkout the [source](https://github.com/johncadengo/johncadengo.github.com/tree/source) branch if you'd like to see how it all works.
