======================
My programmer's blog. It will be pretty sparse for now, but as time goes on I plan to build my own little static blog generator, like Jekyll and Octopress, but much simpler and mostly for my own personal needs. 

Also, be sure to checkout the source branch if you'd like to see how it all works.
