<h1>OPTIMIZATIONS</h1>

<p><a href="http://web.utk.edu/~jplyon/sqlite/SQLite_optimization_FAQ.html">SQLite Optimization FAQ</a> was a great help in compiling this.</p>

<p>Also, I will borrow his copyright notice,</p>

<h2>Pragmas</h2>

<p>Some default values to adjust include:</p>

<ul>
<li>synchronous</li>
<li>cache_size</li>
<li>temp_store</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, when dealing with large data sets, and in the command line, set the following,</p>

<pre><code>.mode csv
.output output.csv
</code></pre>

<p>This way it isn't output to the screen, but to a file. Note, however, that it will also redirect
pragma outputs as well. So if you aren't seeing responses to your commands, they are in the output file.</p>

<h3>Synchronous</h3>
