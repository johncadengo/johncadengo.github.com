This is the source for how I generate the static blog pages. Right now it's a little disorganized, but slowly over time I will refine it and make it more generally useable.

###Blessing
The code, on the other hand, is disclaimed from copyright. 
Instead of a legal notice, I offer a [blessing](http://www.sqlite.org/different.html),

> May you seek good and not evil.
>
> May you find forgiveness for yourself and the grace to forgive others.
>
> May you share freely knowing you were given all things freely by your Creator.
